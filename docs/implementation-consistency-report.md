# Iteration 0 — Implementation Consistency Report

Scope: Repository bootstrap (`docs/architecture-implementation-blueprint.md` §8.1).
Every file below is docstring-only scaffold; no production code (gate statement,
blueprint §8.0). This report maps each generated file to its architectural
owner and normative source.

## Package skeleton (src/episky/)

The tree is a translation of RFC-0001 §5 components plus cross-cutting packages
(blueprint §2). Package-level ownership:

| Package | Owning RFC(s) | Modules |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | RFC-0005 §3/§4/§5/§12; RFC-0003 §2; RFC-0006 §7 | `fact`, `action`, `outcome` |
| `systemmodel` | RFC-0021 | `profiles`, `subsystems` |
| `trust` | RFC-0007 | `classes`, `sanitize`, `hostile` |
| `collectors` | RFC-0005 §2; RFC-0003 §2.4; RFC-0021 | `registry` |
| `factlayer` | RFC-0005 | `collect`, `normalize`, `provenance`, `store` |
| `verification` | RFC-0006 | `compare`, `outcome` |
| `secrets` | RFC-0009 | `classify`, `redact`, `store` |
| `policy` | RFC-0008 | `classify`, `gates`, `tokens`, `policy` |
| `executor` | RFC-0004 §4.9; RFC-0002 §2.8 | `runner`, `guards`, `elevation` |
| `audit` | RFC-0013 | `records`, `store`, `transcript` |
| `context` | RFC-0012 | `assemble`, `boundaries`, `memory`, `provider_view` |
| `providers` | RFC-0010 | `contract`, `view`, `adapters` |
| `skills` | RFC-0011 | `loader`, `activation`, `runtime` |
| `core` | RFC-0002; RFC-0004 §4.3 | `session`, `state_machine`, `events`, `loop`, `consultation`, `replan`, `recovery` |
| `cli` | RFC-0001 §5; RFC-0015 (future) | `render`, `collect`, `expose` |

Count: 64 files (16 package `__init__.py` + 47 modules + root `__init__.py`),
matching blueprint §2 exactly. No module exists outside the blueprint tree, and
every file the blueprint requires exists — verified by
`tests/test_packages.py::test_tree_matches_blueprint_exactly`.

## Docstring-only scaffold

Each file carries a module docstring stating its owning RFC, its
responsibility, and its forbidden responsibility (blueprint §3, §10). No
signatures, no behavior, no TODOs. Signatures are owned by RFC-0020 and will be
introduced in later iterations.

## Tooling & conformance harness

| File | Purpose | Normative basis |
|---|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` | packaging (setuptools src layout), ruff + pytest config | RFC-0020 (implementation); blueprint §2 |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | ruff lint/format + repo hygiene hooks | blueprint §8.1 (tooling) |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI: lint, test, build, RFC validator gate | blueprint §8.1; AGENTS.md; tools/README.md |
| `.gitignore` | Python/venv/build artifact excludes | infra |
| `tests/test_packages.py` | imports every package/module; enforces blueprint §2 tree | blueprint §2, §10 |
| `tests/test_dependency_rules.py` | import-lint: §4.1 allowed edges, §4.2 forbidden edges | blueprint §4.1, §4.2; RFC-0004 §7 |

Dependency rules are transcribed verbatim from blueprint §4.1/§4.2. The §4.2
authority qualifiers (e.g. `policy (decision)`, `factlayer (create)`,
`secrets (values)`) are *use* restrictions, not import bans; those targets
remain import-allowed per §4.1 (see test file comment).

## Test mapping (blueprint §7)

| Test focus | Implemented in |
|---|---|
| Whole-repo: validator exits 0 after `rfc/`/`tools/` change | CI job `rfc-validation` |
| Import smoke (package tree exists and imports) | `tests/test_packages.py` |
| Cross-cutting dependency boundary (forbidden edges, §4.2) | `tests/test_dependency_rules.py` |
| Invariant conformance tests (state machine, F/V/I/A/SC/SK/PR/CM invariants) | deferred to iterations 1+ per §7 table |

The 31 failure-injection scenarios and the happy-path integration test
(blueprint §7 cross-cutting policy) are deferred to the iterations that own the
responsible packages, per `docs/failure-injection-walkthrough.md` and
`docs/core-execution-walkthrough.md`.

## Known limitation

Blueprint §8.1 Definition of Done requires the validator to "exit 0 on the
current corpus". The validator currently reports one pre-existing error in the
frozen corpus:

```
rfc/RFC-0004-trust-and-authority-model.md:470: ERROR unknown invariant identifier 'S1'
```

RFC-0004 is Accepted and normative; fixing it requires an RFC-0003 amendment,
so it is out of scope for Iteration 0 (no edits to accepted RFCs, per AGENTS.md
hard rule 1). The validator is wired into CI as-is; the CI gate is expected to
fail until the corpus is amended. Tracked separately as a known limitation in
the Iteration 0 pull request.
